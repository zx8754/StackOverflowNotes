### Comments
 - [How to make a great R reproducible example?](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5963269)
 - For questions that are not [on-topic](http://stackoverflow.com/help/on-topic), you might want to try in the [R-Public chatroom](http://chat.stackoverflow.com/rooms/25312/r-public).
 - [How to make a Shiny app reproducible example?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/48343080)
 - [How to create a Minimal, Complete, and Verifiable example](http://stackoverflow.com/help/mcve)
 - [What does it mean when an answer is "accepted"?](http://stackoverflow.com/help/accepted-answer)
 - Welcome to StackOverflow! Please read the info about [how to ask a good question](http://stackoverflow.com/help/how-to-ask) and how to give a [reproducible example](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5963269). This will make it much easier for others to help you. - [Jaap](http://stackoverflow.com/users/2204410)
 - Not An Answer - This does not provide an answer to the question. To critique or request clarification from an author, leave a comment below their post - you can always comment on your own posts, and once you [earn](http://meta.stackexchange.com/q/146472/228487) sufficient [reputation](http://stackoverflow.com/help/whats-reputation) you will be able to [comment](http://stackoverflow.com/help/privileges/comment) on any post. If you have a related but different question, [ask a new question](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/ask) referencing this one if it will help provide context. – [BhargavRao](http://stackoverflow.com/users/4099593)
 - Duplicate FAQ: Please read the **FAQ** [How should duplicate questions be handled?](http://meta.stackexchange.com/q/10841/): "It's a duplicate. What do I do?; If you have the privilege to vote to close, click the "close" button under the question, select “duplicate of...”, and paste a link to the duplicate question."; "Should I answer it?; **No**, not if you think it's a duplicate.".
 - Duplicate FAQ: Please also read [The Wikipedia of Long Tail Programming Questions](https://blog.stackoverflow.com/2011/01/the-wikipedia-of-long-tail-programming-questions/). "When you see a question that seems like it might reflect a common problem, don't just answer it to get a few points. That doesn't make the Internet any better. Instead, help us build up a library of canonical questions and answers that are more generic versions of the same question". Also, "**Don't answer questions that have already been answered elsewhere.** Yeah, you might earn a couple of points of reputation, but, because you are duplicating content, **you are actually making the internet worse**".
 - StackOverflow is not a code review service. There is codereview.stackexchange.com for that. If you want to get help - please provide a **minimal** reproducible example, your desired output and show what you've tired. Try reducing this to a specific problem as much a possible. See [here](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5963269). - [David Arenburg](http://stackoverflow.com/users/3001626)
 - Answers (even correct ones) are not useful if they contribute to the demise of the site, [we need to downvote the answers to bad questions](http://meta.stackoverflow.com/a/252531) - [George Cummins](http://meta.stackoverflow.com/users/749181/george-cummins)
 - While the sentiment is appreciated, StackOverflow deprecates [using comments to say "thank you"](http://meta.stackoverflow.com/q/258004); if this answer was useful you can upvote it (if you have sufficient reputation), and in any case if it answers your question satisfactorily you are encouraged to click the check-mark to accept it. - [Ben Bolker](http://stackoverflow.com/users/190277/ben-bolker)
